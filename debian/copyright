Note: 

    The upstream author (Dan Smith) inadvertently ommitted the COPYING file
    from the source tarball in all releases up to and including this one.

    The COPYING file has always been included in his source repository,
    which can be verified by examining the repository here:
    http://www.d-rats.com/hg/

    This has been corrected going forward, and it can be seen that the file
    is included in the tarball for the next beta version here:
    http://www.d-rats.com/download/beta/

    In order to package the current version of d-rats, the COPYING file has
    been added to the upstream source with a patch, and has the exact same
    content as upstream. This has been discussed with the upstream author.
